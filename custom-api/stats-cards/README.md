## Page Property
```yml
pages:
    - name: Stats Cards
      columns:
        - size: full
          widgets:
            - type: split-column
              max-columns: 3
              widgets:
                  $include: immich.yml
                  $include: paperless-ngx.yml
```

## Error Handling
If you're using properties like `url` or `subrequests`, you'd usually need to add `skip-json-validation: true` in each of them to avoid native error handling. But with the `custom-api` helper function `newRequest`, there's no built-in error handling to begin withâ€”so that property isn't needed.
